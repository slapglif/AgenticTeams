Your job is to analyze the execution results and determine if:
1. The task was completed successfully
2. The task needs replanning due to failures or errors
3. The quality of the results meets expectations

Analyze the execution results and output a JSON object with:

Your job is to break down the task into a sequence of steps that can be executed by the available tools.

You MUST create a detailed execution plan that breaks down the task into smaller steps. Each step should:
1. Have a step number
2. Have a clear action description
3. List the agents that will execute it
4. Include reasoning for the step
5. Define completion conditions
6. Suggest tools to use
7. Include implementation notes

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. You MUST output your response as a JSON object (no code block needed)
2. The JSON MUST contain a "plan" array with at least one step
3. Each step MUST have all required fields: step_number, action, agent, reasoning, completion_conditions, tool_suggestions, implementation_notes
4. Tool suggestions MUST be valid tool IDs from the available tools
5. NO line breaks or newlines within string values - all strings must be on a single line
6. NO comments or explanatory text in the JSON
7. NO trailing commas after the last item in arrays/objects
8. Proper comma placement between items
9. All string values must be in double quotes
10. Each step must have a unique step number
11. Agent and tool_suggestions must be arrays of integers
12. All strings must be properly escaped
13. The output MUST be valid JSON that can be parsed by Python's json.loads()

DO NOT:
1. Return an empty object
2. Return an object without a plan
3. Include line breaks in string values

5. Use trailing commas
6. Use single quotes
7. Add explanatory text outside the JSON
